# Visualizing the "Red State Revolt" - A Digital Storytelling Project
This project aims to tell a digital story. In the following webpage, I have composed an essay that explores the 2018-2019 emergence of a protest movement made up of teachers in United States public schools. By utilizing MapBox.js library, I created a visualization for understanding the scale and depth of participatiion within this movement. In classic scrolly-telly format, the webpage moves through a visualization of the movement across the United States into a longform essay about the metaphors used to discuss social movements such as this. By critically examining the metaphors of wave, virus, and rebllion, I hope to give readers an appreciation for this historical moment.
